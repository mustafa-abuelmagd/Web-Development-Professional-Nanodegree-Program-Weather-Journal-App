# Weather-Journal App Project

## Overview
This project requires you to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI. 

## setting up the server
- first I created the projectData object to hold the date that'll be sent and received
- instaalling require and body-parser and cors to the server
- and finally setting up a new instance of the server 


## get and post requests
- the get request is set for the date received from the server to the client/app
- the post request is set to send the data entries will be used to fetch the data we need to complete and update the UI

## starting off the server on port 8000


------------------------
## client side
-- created the api key used later for getting info (link was only assimbled out of three pieces)

-- the perform action function was also straight forward from the lessons
-- the postdata function used the url formed and stored the data fetched in the criables date, temp, feeling, and I added another eleent which what the temp feels like(tried to do the lacation to prient out the city of the postal code provided but the post request didn't get the main.name )

--postdata is called after getting the get weather function and getting the pieces of data we need, created a new object that held the date, temp, feeling, and what it feels like.

-- and at the end the update ui function was used to keep the retrieved data on the page printed out
